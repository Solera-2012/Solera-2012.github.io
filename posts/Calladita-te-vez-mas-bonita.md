# Redefining el dicho: Calladita Te Vez Mas Bonita

There’s a saying in Spanish that goes, 
> calladita te vez mas bonita

If you’re quieter you look prettier. You would hear it from the people you looked up to: parents, tias, tios, primas y primos… It’s not that they meant harm with El Dicho. Sometimes Ma would say it at misa when she caught you snickering at the señora in front with a wedgie. Sometimes your tia would say it after you crossed the line with a teasing joke about your primo. Or sometimes your prima would use it after you said una groseria in public.  

Every single time, El Dicho is a scolding. You step out of line and they remind you that you look better when you’re not talking… 

Stop Talking.  

But you can’t.  Not when you **KNOW**.
 
Now what? You spent so much time perfecting your quiet spirit that it feels wrong to raise your voice. To actually give your opinion and potentially cut someone off? Never!

And then it hits you: “You’re so pretty”  “She’s gorgeous!” “Mira, que bonita”.

*El dicho* is true. 

You're stunned. But only for a moment. For that solid minute that it takes you to ground your feet, stand taller, and smile. Because the entire time everyone else was noticing how quiet and pretty you are, you noticed everything else. 


I think that what I want to come out of this is that there is more than one path to the revolution. while one might include a bold outspoken personality. Another can involve a gentle presence that strikes from within…This is why I feel drawn to the legal field. I can’t change the system alone, but I can certainly demystify the law and use my leverage to advocate. Be able to use the law as a tool
