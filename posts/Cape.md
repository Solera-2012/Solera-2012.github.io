If you think youâ€™re gonna go out there and fix everything, honey, sit down.
>-Andre Pruitt, *Oppression and Privilege*, 2015

Systems of oppression. 

A system is a set of things working together as parts of a complex whole. 

Oppression is the unjust treatment of a person or group over a period of time. 

And when we piece them back together we realize: There Is ORDER to the MADNESS.

The snap of a finger, the flick of a light, and it all makes sense.
