#How To hang with Gringos

Do *not* use a single utensil to eat your food.  
But Do work your way through the ensemble of tools on the table “From the Outside In”.
<hr>

Do *not* think it is enough to express your gratitude in person.  
But Do mail a templated note of appreciation within one month of the event.

<hr>
Do *not* speak your native language (it’s “rude”).  
But Do play the role of **interpreter** and **translator** without compensation.

<hr>
Do *not* make food that’s too spicy.  
But Do prepare your exotic cuisine on numerous occasions.

<hr>
Point out that you have a close relation who is white.   
They don’t see color, as long as you don’t tell them they won’t suspect it.

<hr>
