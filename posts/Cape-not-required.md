Systems of oppression.

A system is a set of things working together as parts of a complex whole.

Oppression is the unjust treatment of a person or group over a period of time.

And when we piece them back together we realize: There Is ORDER to the MADNESS.

The snap of a finger, the flick of a light, and it all makes sense.
