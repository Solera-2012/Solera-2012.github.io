*What do you like to do on your free time?*  
I mostly stay home, or go to the gym. I like to lift weights.  

*That’s great! Have you tried any new places to eat yet?*  
No, not really. I have just been cooking at home.  


**INTERPRETER**: And they don’t get very much money, you know.  


*your privilege is showing*
